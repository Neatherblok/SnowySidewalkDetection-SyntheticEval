# Synthetic Snowy Sidewalk Image Generation and Evaluation

## Overview

This project evaluates the ability of three prompt-based synthetic image generators—**OpenAI’s DALL-E 3**, **Google’s Imagen 3**, and **xAI’s Grok**—to produce realistic winter sidewalk scenes. The synthetic images are assessed using a pretrained **sidewalk snow detection network** to determine how closely they resemble real-world data.

## Prompt

The following prompt was used to generate 200 images from each model:

```
Generate a realistic winter scene from a first-person pedestrian perspective, looking down at a cracked concrete sidewalk. The sidewalk is partially covered with icy, slushy snow, concentrated along the edges where snow transitions into ice. Footprints are visible in the icy patches. The left side of the image shows accumulated snow with small patches of brown grass peeking through. The lighting is natural, with soft daylight, capturing the texture of the snow, ice, and sidewalk in a cold, wintry outdoor setting.
```

This prompt was created by **OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4** after analyzing a real-world snowy sidewalk image from a test dataset by **de Deijn & Bukralia (2024)**.

## Evaluation

The images generated by each model are evaluated using a pretrained sidewalk snow detection network developed by **de Deijn (2024)**. This model was trained on 98 real-world RGB images of sidewalks in clear and snowy conditions and achieves an average **F2 score of 68.19%** on a real-world snowy sidewalk test set.

### Metrics

- **F2 Score:** Measures the accuracy of snow detection.
- **Comparison:** Synthetic images are benchmarked against a test set of 200 real-world snowy sidewalk images to assess similarity to real-world conditions.

## Repository Contents

- **`collect_images/`**: Script for synthetic image collection from HuggingFace.
- **`evaluation/`**: Code for evaluating images using the pretrained sidewalk snow detection network.
